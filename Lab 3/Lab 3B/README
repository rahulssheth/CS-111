README


This tarball has three separate files:

README 

This is the current file.

Makefile

This is the file that deals with compilation. It has three separate commands:

1. make 
   Default make which compiles and output the lab3b executable. Takes in lab3b.cpp 
   -Note: utilizes the -static-libstdc++ flag. 
2. make dist
   Creates the tarball with lab3b.cpp, Makefile, and README
3. make clean:
   Takes out the executable and the tarball


lab3b.cpp: 

This is a C++-Source module that contains the implementation of the csv checks. It initially sets up the global variables, looking at the superblock, placing all blocks that should be referenced in a vector, extracting the filename, etc. Then it performs the checks in the following order:
1. Checking the free inodes and unallocated inodes. Then it proceeds to check all the indirect blocks and sets up the duplicate block implementation. 
2. Checking to see if a block has been referenced more than once. 
3. Checking all of the directory entries to see if they are valid. 
4. Checking all of the reference counts to see if they match up with the linkcounts. 
5. Checking if there are any unreferenced blocks.
