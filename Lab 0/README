The lab0.c file is the single C file with the implementation. 
The two png files contain the GDB work I did. 
The Makefile has all of the commands for make that I wrote 
This README has general information for the tarball. 

For this project, I utilized a fair amount of documentation. 

1. To get an example of using the getOpt_Long function, I looked to the source file of the ls command to see how it is implemented there. 

2. For the reads and writes, I utilized the link provided by Professor Reiher, File Descriptor Management. 

3. For writing the signal handler, I utilized the man page for signal handlers and saw how to implement it based on that.

4. For the Makefile, I used the format from past projects from CS 35L as inspiration for how to write mine for this project.

5. Finally, I gained general assistance from my TA for the Makefile and smoke check. 


SMOKE CHECK: 

1. The first check is there to accomplish using standard files in the directory. 

2. The second check is to see if we input the files directly, without the —input and —output commands, and see if it works. 

3. The third check checks if we accurately implemented the catch command

4. The fourth check sees if we correctly implemented segfault. 

5. The fifth check sees if we identify nonexistent files and error out

6. The sixth check sees what happens if we give a file that should not be opened to write.
